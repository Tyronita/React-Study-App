### Install dependencies
- Just run the command `npm i` and it'll install all the dependencies you need

# How to start it
`npm start`

## Folder structure
- `./src` is where all our code will go, everything else is pretty much just stuff for react
- `./src/components` is where all the react components will go so we can use them in any page 
- `./src/pages` is where the 'webpages' will go, they're essentially just files with functions which return a div that can be rendered on the page
- `./src/styles` put all your css here - check other code to see how to import it
